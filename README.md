# Clustering-Assignment

The dataset given to us consists of cost, nutritional information and shelf location of 16 different
kinds of breakfast cereals. The task is to make sense out of this data using the proper model and
interpret the results. We start with a list of probable statistical tools & methods that can be applied
and then choose the best among them by the process of elimination. We find that clustering is
the best approach to model this dataset. K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering
(Centroid, Wardâ€™s, single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage) have been implemented
using R programming language.
